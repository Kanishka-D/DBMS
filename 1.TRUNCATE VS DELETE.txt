1.Difference between Truncate and Delete Command?
   DELETE:
•	It is used to delete one or all records in table.
                    EXAMPLE: 
                      DELETE FROM TABLE_NAME;
                       COMMIT;
                       DELETE FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE NAME="ANU";
                       COMMIT;
•	It is can use WHERE condition(ie can filter the table).
•	It is DML command so it needs to be COMMIT(to save the changes made).It can ROLLBACK.
•	It is slower than TRUNCATE.
 TRUNCATE:
•	It is used to truncate all records.
                    EXAMPLE:
                      TRUNCATE TABLE TABLE_NAME;
•	WHERE condition cant be used.
•	It is DDL command so there is no need for COMMIT.
•	It is Faster than Delete.
